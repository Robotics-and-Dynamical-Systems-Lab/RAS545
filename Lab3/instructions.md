# Laboratory 3: Digital Twin of mycobot pro 600
This laboratory activity is to create a digital twin of mycobot 280 M5. 

## Pre-requisites
1. Activities of the laboratory 2 must be completed before commencing this laboratory. 
2. Install all software requirements and ensure you have the right hardware to perform the lab. 
3. Read the product parameters of mycobot pro 600 before proceeding with this lab. 
4. Please refer to Elephant Robotics mycobot pro 600 website.

## Software Requirements

1. MATLAB (Recommended): See how to obtain license for MATLAB for ASU students. Instructions to install MATLAB can be found [here](https://ets.engineering.asu.edu/research/software-collaboration-tools/). Scroll down to find MATLAB installation instructions.


## Laboratory 3 Tasks

1. Create a Kinematic diagram for mycobot pro 600 ( 1 point)

2. Derive all homogeneous transformation Matrices (1 point)

3. Solve forward kinematic problem using MATLAB - Given joint angles, find the end effector (e.e.) position (1 point)

4. Import the CAD model of mycobot pro 600  (https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/mycobot-pi-en/4-BasicApplication/4.5-files_download.html) in MATLAB as discussed and add joints  https://www.mathworks.com/help/sm/ug/import-robot-arm-model.htmlLinks. ( 1 point)

5. Perform the forward kinematic analysis in SIMCSCAPE /Robotics toolbox as shown here (2 points)

You should collect the angles from the mycobot 600 pro, and digital twin should reach the same e.e. position 

6. Create a 3 min video ( 2 points) as shown

showing actual robot validation along with MATLAB simulation and SIMSCAPE animation


## Upload:

1. Detailed Report with all the equations (3 points).

2. Matlab Scripts, SIMULINKÂ files (3 points)

3. Video (2 points)


**NOTE**: *Even though MATLAB is recommended, students are open to try different software (eg. blender) to create the digital twin according to their expertise*.
